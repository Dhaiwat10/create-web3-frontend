The fastest way to get started with a fully-fledged web3 frontend setup consisting of Next.js, [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh), [Rainbowkit](https://rainbowkit.com), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

```bash
npx create-web3-frontend
```

## Thanks

This project is inspired by and re-uses a lot of code from [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app/).
